Moon Child was the first game project I worked on as a part of my course at *Vancouver Film School*. Me and a team of three other's worked together to design, plan, and build the entire game, including art assets, visual effects, code, level, and sound. The game was inspired by a chilean story called the little prince. It is about a boy who's lost his mother and with the help of his pet dog, he decides to try finding her in the moon. There were two levels, the first where you controlled Remo in a *Crash Bandicoot* style 3D platformer, and the second where you rode the puppy-turned-wolf Luna towards the moon in a *Temple Run* style of game.

My job as a part of the team was to program the game using *C#* and *Unity3D*. This was my first time coding a large project, and *VFS* was the first time I had properly programmed anything at all. I learned quickly. Thanks to the support of my teachers, teammates, and classmates, I was able to go from no coding experience to being able to finish this game in about four months, and I have only been improving since. 

In this game I programmed two character controllers; one for each level of the game. The controller for Remo was the first and most complicated one. It involved a complex state machine that controlled his jumping, damage, active, paused, and attacking states, as well as movement, physics for when he was hit by enemies, and animations that correlated to his states.

The second character controller was for Luna, when the puppy would turn into a wolf and the Remo would ride her towards the moon. This controller was much simpler, and I was able to code it in the last two weeks of the project. The controller worked similar to the first one, but movement was locked so they were constantly moving forward, so the player only had control going left or right and jumping. 

Other features I worked to create was enemy behavior, triggers that would activate when the player used their abilities on them, and shader manipulation to show enemies in a stunned state when attacked.
