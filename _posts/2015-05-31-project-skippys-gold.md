Skippy's Gold was a five week term project me and five other programmers worked on. This was the first large project I worked on with a team of programmers, instead of a team with assorted skills and abilities. Our theme for the project was mobile thinking games, and the result we came up with was Skippy's Gold, a simple mobile game where the player had to memorize increasingly complicated paths to guide the pirate Skippy from one side of a dark cave to the gold on the other side. 

We decided on *Unity3D* as the engine to run our game on because it built easily to phones and other devices, and I had experience with it. We tried to use *Git* as our repository management tool, however due to issues with *Git* and *Unity3D* along with our extremely limited time-frame, we decided on using *Google Drive* to store all of our code, while my job became that of the project captain, looking over everyone's code, checking it for errors, and combining it so it worked as one coherent whole. Overall it worked out well, we had few issues, and our project came out amazingly. 

On top of being project captain, I was also responsible for teaching everyone how *Unity3D* worked, as none of them had experience, and helped them with how to code certain features and design systems so they would best run in this environment. I personally worked on the algorithm that created the random path, and drew the path tiles and treasure.
