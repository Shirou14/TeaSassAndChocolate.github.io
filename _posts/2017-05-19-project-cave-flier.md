Cave Flier was our final industry project for BCIT. During these three weeks, we were tasked with coding a Virtual Reality game using *Unity3D* and *GoogleVR* platforms for our client, *Ace3DFX*. The game was a flight simulator where the player would use their phone's accelerometer to steer their way through a cave filled with randomly generated obstacles and power-ups. 

My main job on the project was designing a player collision, detecting whether the collision was head on or glancing to determine how much health to subtract, and detecting variable distances to tell how close a player got to an object in order to alot points. I made a system that allowed designers to determined different range sizes that allocated points, and displayed these ranges as a series of sphere's around the player. This system modified the *Unity3D* editor so the ranges could be seen dynamically in and outside of runtime.

Because of my previous work on [Moon Child](/2012/10/19/project-moon-child.html) and [Skippy's Gold](/2015/05/31/project-skippys-gold.html) I had a lot of experience with *Unity3D* and often served as my teams advisor when it came to features of the engine. I helped steer my team towards potential solutions to their problems and helped them discover tools they could use to better design their own systems. This experience was very useful when it came to debugging the game and fixing issues, where I used break points and debug statements to narrow down the problem and fix it. I also used my previous experience to design a simple, useful state machine to control the player's behavior,which helped when dealing with death, menu, and victory conditions.

Working on this game was a great experience; it refreshed my experience in the *Unity3D* engine, game design, and gave me valuable experience in Virtual Reality.
